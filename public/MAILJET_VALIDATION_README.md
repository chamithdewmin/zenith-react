# Mailjet Domain Validation

## File Validation Method (Current)

The validation file `aa9238131a1055866dfe3a4c7fead6a4.txt` has been created in the public directory.

### Steps to Complete Validation:

1. **Upload the file to your server root**
   - The file should be accessible at: `https://zenithscs.com.au/aa9238131a1055866dfe3a4c7fead6a4.txt`
   - Make sure the file is empty (as it currently is)

2. **Verify the file is accessible**
   - Visit the URL above in your browser
   - You should see a blank page (empty file)

3. **Click "Validate my domain" in Mailjet**
   - Go to your Mailjet dashboard
   - Click the "Validate my domain" button for the file method

4. **After validation**
   - You can delete this file once validation is complete
   - The domain will remain validated

## Alternative: DNS Record Method

If you prefer to use DNS validation instead:

### DNS TXT Record:
- **Host/Name:** `mailjet._aa923813`
- **Value:** `aa9238131a1055866dfe3a4c7fead6a4`
- **Type:** TXT
- **TTL:** 3600 (or default)

Add this TXT record to your domain's DNS settings, then click "Validate my domain" in Mailjet.

## Notes:

- The file method is easier and faster
- DNS method is more permanent but requires DNS access
- Once validated, you can use `noreply@zenithscs.com.au` as the sender email
- This will significantly improve email deliverability and reduce spam
